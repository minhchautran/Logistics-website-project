Vietfly is an air freight transportation service company that delivers goods from the United States to Vietnam. They offer three types of transportation services:

Airport: Customers can pick up their goods at the airport in Vietnam.

Station: Customers can pick up their goods at Vietfly's branches in major cities in Vietnam.

Door: Vietfly delivers goods to the customer's doorstep.

The pricing for each service varies depending on the destination in Vietnam, the type of products being shipped, and the weight/volume of the package. Additionally, customers can choose additional services such as wood framing, weekend delivery, express delivery, etc., which will incur additional charges.

Customers can register for shipping via phone from their homes or bring their goods directly to Vietfly's branches in the United States. After receiving the goods, Vietfly's staff records information about the shipment, including customer names, sender and receiver names and addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, the number of packages, package volume and weight, type of products, product value, and selected transportation services. The staff will calculate the fees and inform the customer. Customers can also purchase insurance for their goods or use discount vouchers if available. Various payment methods such as cash, credit cards, and bank transfers are accepted. Customers receive an invoice with shipment details and an estimated arrival date in Vietnam. Payment is only made after the customer agrees to the price and services.

Vietfly's staff enters shipment information into an Excel export list for management purposes. The goods are then handed over to the warehouse department for sorting and management to prevent errors in delivery when the goods arrive in Vietnam.

Additionally, Vietfly has a team of planners responsible for booking flights with airlines. Their goal is to optimize packages with corresponding weights, volumes, and services that customers have sent. Planners coordinate orders, contact airlines for pricing and costs, book flights, and store flight invoices for reconciliation and payment. They also update shipment information in a Google Sheets file for managing shipments on a per-flight basis. Once specific shipment information is available, planners send it to the warehouse department for planning outbound shipments. The warehouse staff categorizes shipments by region. On the scheduled shipping date, warehouse employees load the goods onto trucks for transportation to the airport, unload them at the airport, and receive confirmation of delivery from airport staff before returning.

Goods are then received by Vietfly staff in Vietnam, checked for accuracy, and loaded onto trucks for transportation to the station (for items delivered at the station, staff contacts customers for direct pickup). The station's planners plan the deliveries, warehouse staff receives and categorizes the goods by region, and the delivery team, using trucks or motorcycles, or contacting domestic transportation partners, delivers the goods to customers.

Currently, Vietfly's transportation business is expanding, and they are facing challenges in managing their warehouse and spending a lot of time and effort on planning, sorting, and calculating fees for customers. As a Business Analyst (BA), you and your team can suggest several ways to help Vietfly improve and increase productivity to achieve efficiency. These could include implementing better warehouse management systems, streamlining planning processes, and improving fee calculation and payment processes.
